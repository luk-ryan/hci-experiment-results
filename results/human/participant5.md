# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Friendly, Quick

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - moderate, right in the middle

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - Didn't hinder engagement, friendly tone made it more engaging.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - Neutral

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Allowed me to remain calm while following instructions

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - The tone felt appropriate and professional for the specific task. Articulation and annunciation made certain tasks unclear, which made it slightly more frustrating and feeling the need to pay more attention. Pacing of syllables is important for efficiency.
  - Alternative labels so there is no confusion between letters (i.e. Beta, Epsilon instead of B and E)
