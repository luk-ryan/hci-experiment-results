asked if he was done before the last step was said as he was reaching the end
put shapes back by trying to put them to origin through most of the experiment

Qualitative

1. What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?
kind of Heavy - anunciation of the person was hard, felt that AI's normally are more straight forward to hear over humans who can jumble words
smooth - didnt feel awkward to listen to 

2. How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice? 
5/10 - neither hard or difficult. instructions were clear but B2/E2 was confusing

Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response): 
3. Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that 
was? 
indifferent - "just a voice you know".
engaged with the instructions but felt as the voice didn't change engagement
4. How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? 
(e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)? 
felt easy to use. when I asked what to repeat things it did it perfectly.
the voice had no effect on mood
"its a good voice why would I be frusturated?"

5. Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while 
following instructions? 
felt relaxed. The voice speaking with a human cadence, didn't feel an anxiety cause it was just a person to them

User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts): 
Would have a chat with the bot again.
Only "issue" would be sound specifity of certain words

(if the voice were to change in any sort of way, do you think a different voice could have helped you better in any sort of aspect?)
the voice I felt wouldn't have any impact, but maybe a more energetic voice could keep me gauged. not exactly for completing tasks though, I wouldn't know if it would help with task completion
