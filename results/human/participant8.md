# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Monotone, too fast, bad articulation

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - Slightly difficult

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - Less engaging because it was boring. The interface was simple, so it was harder to focus. The voice was speaking too fast and I could not keep up, so I had to keep asking to go back.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - Bored

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Kept me bored and not too engaged, but also not really mad at the voice. The task itself was fun however.

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - Didn't really enjoy monotone of the voice, its articulation, as well as the speed of the voice. Not stimulating enough. Would probably have a similar experience with either robot voice or human voice.
