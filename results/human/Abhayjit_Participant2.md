# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**


  - good voice and understandable just step 2 was confusing

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - instructions were clear but speed made it challenging


## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - didn't feel either it was neutral

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - not negative but somewhat demanding

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - slightly the one step 2 made it annoying to follow as hearing b2 as e2 made it confusing

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - it was okay, i would say it was a good experience but make it more clear the voice could be worked on making it more understandable. it wasn't clear at some points
