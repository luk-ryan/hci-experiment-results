# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Clear, conscise, very directive

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - Once I was able to switch my headset, it was very crystal clear and straight to the point. I didn't see any clarifications issues when
    I was being instructed to move any of the shapes.

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - It made it engaging. It was very clear as to what I needed to do from the voice.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - It did not make me stressed out. I am used to faster pace. Personally, when I give insturctions, I tend to deliver them with a certain cadence or pace. And this voice met my pace. I knew kind of what exactly I needed to do when I needed to do and at the speed that the voice was telling me to do I was kind of able to do that at an efficient pace. So, to me personally it all worked out.

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Tone of voice was neutral. It didn't give me a sense of hurry nor give me a sense of you can take your time kind of feeling.

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - Enjoyed. It was very crystal clear to the point. I was able to follow the tasks without having to have the proctor to repeat themselves. Because the voice give the instructions very clearly.
