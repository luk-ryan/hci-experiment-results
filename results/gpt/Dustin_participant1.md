# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Fast, acccented (Canadian), inhuman, text-to-speech

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - Instructions very easy, but sped was difficult
  - Not easy. Sweating at the end.

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - This specific voice didn't feel like a natural voice. Text-to-speech-like, but accent is like Canadian, where voice pitch is inconsistent. It felt commanding. 
    It also made me feel immersed and focused, and the speed didn't let me feel bored. 

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - Didn't feel anything particular, but was slightly panicking at the end.

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - If the voice was more monotone than it currently is, it would have made me feel more disengaged.

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - Overall, it was interesting. Did not want to call back to a specific point. Knew for a fact that I would have forgotten the step number. Only issue with this voice: it's way too fast. 
    It also doesn't have a tone difference, mostly the same throughout. I was already anticipating movements based on the voice because it was the same.
  - He is a gamer and has good eye coordiantion
