# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Robotic, fast, monotone

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - difficult to understand

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - More engaging than if the instructions were just text, because I didn't have to read, so most of my focus could be on the actual task itself.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - neutral

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Not really, doesn't feel personal because it feels like the voice doesn't have a personal stake in this.

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - Primarily negative because it doesn't wait for you to finish before giving the next instruction. It's easy to lose track of which step you are on. Voice gives no feedback after every instruction.
  - Recommended improvements for the experiment: give the user ability to control audio.
