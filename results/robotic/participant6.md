# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with?**

  - Robotic, unemotional, bad rhythm, inhumane pauses, fast, intense

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - Easy, straightforward

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - More engaging; A normal human would not be able to talk as quickly, making it more challenging. If a human was talking as fast as the robot voice, clarity of instructions might fall.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - Neutral

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Yes, because it was a robotic voice, made me focus more on the task at hand, while if it was a human voice, I would care more about the speaker and less focused on the task.

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - When it comes to completing the task, voice was very clear and precise, which helped with finishing quickly. Did a good job of being fast while still being understandable.
