# Qualitative data collection

All thoughts and concerns during the experiment, rough outline of precieved feelings and such the like.
frustrations all together as well

## Perceived Ease of Use (Clarity and Understanding):

- **What keywords would you use to describe the voice you worked with**

  - Robotic, Monotone, pushy, too fast

- **How easy or difficult was it to understand the instructions given by the voice?**

  - 3/5, somewhat easy

## Trust Rating (Engagement & Motivation + Emotional Response):

- **Did the voice make the task feel more or less engaging? Why do you think that was?**

  - A little engaging; Sounded Robotic (10% human), could have a better/customizable voice. Would be cool to have it role play.

- **How did interacting with the voice make you feel throughout the process? (e.g., frustrated, encouraged, neutralâ€¦)?**

  - A little frustrated.

- **Did the specific tone or style of the voice influence your mood or attitude while following instructions?**

  - Yes, the voice was annoying, because he was going too fast. When I told him to chill, he would not react fast enough. Voice too monotone

## User Satisfaction (Final Thoughts):

- **How would you describe your overall experience working with the voice to complete the task?**

  - Pretty Interesting. I like being what to do. Things that were said could be said better, and the type of voice could also be better. Would also like to say my reaction time was a little slow, but feel like the voice was talking a little too fast.
